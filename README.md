# Machine Learning Approaches for Clustering and Forecasting GDP Growth

This research project is being carried out by Geroge Kontos, an Honours Student of the Honours Programme Bachelor of TU Delft. The research is being conducted under the supervision of Dr. N. Parolya.

This project aims to investigate the effectiveness of machine learning approaches for clustering and long-horizon forecasting of international financial growth. This project uses the predictions published by Dr. U.K. Mueller, Dr. J.H.Stock and Dr. Mark. W. Watson in their work [An Econometric Model of International Growth Dynamics for Long-horizon Forecasting](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article/104/5/857/97738/An-Econometric-Model-of-International-Growth) as a baseline for evaluation and comparisons of the foundings of machine learning models.

Jupyter notebooks present different clustering and forecsting methods. The logic is implemented in the following directories:
- `Clustering`
- `Forecasting`
- `Utils`

Results of each individual experiment and related figures are included in the `Results` directory
